# Obesity Prediction Using Ensemble Learning

This project applies supervised machine learning techniques to predict obesity levels based on health and lifestyle metrics.

##  Dataset
The dataset used for this project was self-selected and contains anonymized data on individuals' physical attributes, eating habits, and activity levels. The target variable represents categorized obesity levels.  
(Source: Public dataset available on platforms like UCI or Kaggle)

##  Techniques Used
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Gradient Boosting Classifier

Each model was evaluated based on classification accuracy, confusion matrix, and cross-validation scores.

##  Results
Ensemble models significantly improved prediction accuracy compared to a single classifier. Gradient Boosting showed the best performance.

##  How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure the dataset `Obesity prediction.csv` is in the root directory.
3. Open `Nasim_Bayati_CC3_Project1_Obesity.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
4. Run all cells to replicate results.

##  Disclaimer
This project was developed as a personal learning project using a public dataset. It was originally created as part of a machine learning coursework but has been restructured for public sharing and educational use. No proprietary course materials or instructions are included.
